# Hi ! I'm Flying-Tree

My real name : Olivier Henry.

I'm a French student (that's a reason for my language mistakes) of the LycÃ©e Henri IV in Paris.

It is maybe not a surprise but I like physics, mathematics and of course computer science.

By the way, I use to study Olympic maths (the IMO for example) and I took part in the 2020 JBMO as a contestant.

## What I do on GitHub

I use this account to upload my personal work (not the one for school) for my friends, and for anyone needing it.

However, I may accept to contribute to someone else's project if I am interested in this work, in a way or another.

## Abilities

- HTML-CSS-JavaScript : basic basis.
- Python : I consider that I know what has to be known about it.
- Unity : I'm trying to learn to develop with Unity.
- Bash : I can do simple scripts to improve the interface of my computer, and I can use the command line for most tasks.
- Also, I used to code with Scratch. It was so funny ! ðŸ˜º

## Contact me

I'm still thinking about a public e-mail.
